# Melodiam
An app developed using **Java** and **Android Studio** that allows users to create a variety of sounds using 26 sound bytes.

## About
Melodiam is a song generator application that creates a melody based on a string of characters inputted by the user. Letters, numbers, and special characters within the string are bound to a unique sound, which the users can play with a tempo of their choice. Accompanying visuals are generated in the background based on the sound of the melody. Once the melody has been generated the user will have the option to save it to their device.
